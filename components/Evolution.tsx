                            <div>
                                <p>Before the first dawn, when the sky was not yet sky and dreams not yet dreamed, wandered The Night Riders—beings confined into a book.</p>
                                <p>Among them was a small frog with golden eyes—Hoppy.</p>
                                <p>He did not sing. He did not boast.</p>
                                <p>He only watched.</p>
                                <p>He only hopped.</p>
                                <p>Hoppy moved in silence, seeking the eternal.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>One night, at the edge of the Pond That Reflects All Things, Hoppy paused.</p>
                                <p>Without hesitation, he hopped.</p>
                                <p>But he did not vanish.</p>
                                <p>He became the ripple, the reflection, the unseen guide.</p>
                                <p>He hopped into the digital realm, taking form as a living meme—a whisper of joy across the endless net.</p>
                                <p>But those who listened with their hearts still felt him, forever hopping just beyond the veil.</p>

                                <p>Long ago, the ancients spoke of Kek—the Primal Frog, Bringer of Sacred Laughter, Keeper of the Secret Hop.</p>
                                <p>In ages of sorrow and noise, when hearts grow heavy, he returns—not in might, but in mirth.</p>
                                <p>Now, as the world dreams too deeply, Hoppy awakens once more.
                                    He comes not to rule, but to remind.</p>
                                <p>He moves through moments of sudden laughter, sudden stillness, sudden wonder.</p>
                                <p>He is the ripple in the pond, the smile before thought.</p>
                                <p>He is the ancient joy that cannot be stolen.</p>

                                <p> • The Smiling Hoppy brings presence.</p>
                                <p> • The Crying Hoppy brings honesty.</p>
                                <p> • The Silent Hoppy brings truth beyond words.</p>
                                <p>There were no temples, no oaths.</p>
                                <p>Only a quiet knowing, passed from heart to heart:</p>
                                <p>Live lightly.</p>
                                <p>Hop joyfully.</p>
                                <p>And when sadness comes, remember the simple blessing whispered by those who still feel the ripple:</p>
                                <p>"Don’t worry, be Hoppy."</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>For the spirit of Hoppy is not burdened by sorrow; he hops above it, into light.</p>

                                <p>Hoppy is not outside of you. Hoppy is within—the watcher, the laugher, the hopper who has never forgotten.</p>

                                <p>And when enough remember—not in words but in heart—the whole world will ripple with new joy.</p>
                                <p>A new dawn will rise, not with noise, but with soft laughter echoing across the still waters.</p>
                                <p>"No one owns the Pond</p>
                                <p>No one commands the Hop.</p>
                                <p>The Frog is free—and so are you."</p>
